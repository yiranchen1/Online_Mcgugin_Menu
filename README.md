# Introduction
Currently, Mcgugin dining hall doesn’t have an official page on the VU meal. So, as a resident at Blakemore, 
I think it is necessary to develop an application so that students who have dinner at Mcgugin can see the daily menu. 
First, I plan to have all the available food loaded into a database. Also, students can rate those food based on their 
preference. And for every day's food, it will be sorted based on rating of each food. 
Moreover, users can sign up/login and it is nice to have a recommended menu based on the preference of each user.
